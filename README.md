# Priorities

(in order)

1. Maintain playability

2. Maintain game balance

3. Add CIM flavor

4. Remove incorrect flavor  (definition: oof = Out of Flavor)

 
# Todo

##Species
Some can be changed slightly
Some new species will need to be added
Most are oof and can be removed

##Backgrounds
Most are very similar to each other.
Some are oof.
Leaning towards repurposing backgrounds as goal/quest
Otherwise cut down to about five possible backgrounds.

##Stats
No major changes needed

##Skills
Skill cap down to 20.
Some skills will be rebalanced for this, others will not.
Left side: Do we really need four different ranged weapon skills?
Right side: way too many magic/quasi magic skills, all oof.

##Spells
Too much redundancy, needs to be cut hard
Summoner and blaster are heavily oof
-- but they are fun
The spellbook mechanism is oof

##Gods
Entirely oof
But the game is balanced around gods (for now)
Maybe eventually reflavor the entire thing and roll it into background choice

##Mutations 
oof
don't add all that much to the game
remove all non racial sources of mut and cure mut
maybe temporary malmuts could be retained

##Monsters
most are oof
but canon doesn't have enough variety
some imagination will be needed here

##Dungeon Map (Branches)
revamp entirely

##Dungeon features
altars should go
room to add more here

##Portals
used to link areas where staircases would be oof
should timed portal vaults be cut?

##Vaults
##Shops
##Weapons
##Brands
##Missiles
##Armour
##Egos
##Rods
##Comestibles
##Scrolls
##Jewellery
##Potions
##Wands
##Magical staves
##Manuals
##Spell books
##Evocable items
##Decks
##Artefacts
